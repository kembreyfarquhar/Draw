# Draw Something

This project was inspired by the HTML5 canvas project in the [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge, created by Wes Bos. This was one of my first projects ever attempted in JavaScript, and it was so invigorating that it encouraged me to keep learning more about code.

Creative coding fascinates me, and I hope to continue learning more and creating more.
